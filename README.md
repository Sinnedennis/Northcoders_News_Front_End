### Neat features:
1. Make use of the component tree diagram in the root
2. Default avatar on userpage (many in seed data are kaput)
3. Ordered articles/comments by oldest, newest, highest and lowest rated
4. Pagination
5. Animated loading bar (this will be upgraded to a spinner with time)

### To-do list:
Basic styling has been applied to the main feed, but some more time needs to be spent on the userpage, article and comments, and loading/error components.
