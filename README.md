### Neat features:
1. Make use of the component tree diagram in the root
2. Default avatar on userpage (many in seed data are kaput)
3. Ordered articles/comments by oldest, newest, highest and lowest rated
4. Pagination
5. Animated loading bar (this will be upgraded to a spinner with time)

### To-do list:
* Styling for:
  * Article and comments
  * User Page
  * Loading and Error components
* Remove elements that aren't needed (less is more) for example: index numbers for articles
* Style voting buttons into arrows
* Readme and intallation instructions
